# MIAAIM: multi-modal imaging alignment and analysis by information manifolds
MIAAIM is a software to align multiple-omics bioimaging tissue imaging data. The worflow includes high-dimensional image compression, registration, and transforming images to align in the same spatial domain. MIAAIM was developed at the [Vaccine and Immunotherapy Center at MGH](http://advancingcures.org) and is written in [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io) with containerized workflows to enable modular development and applicability across diverse computing architectures.
