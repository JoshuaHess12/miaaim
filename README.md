MIAAIM (multi-modal imaging alignment and analysis by information manifolds) is a software to align multiple-omics bioimaging tissue imaging data. The MIAAIM worflow includes high-dimensional image compression, registration, and transforming images to align in the same spatial domain. MIAAIM was developed at the [Vaccine and Immunotherapy Center at MGH](http://advancingcures.org) and is written in Nextflow with containerized workflows to enable continuous improvement and applicability across diverse computing architectures.
