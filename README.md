# MIAAIM: multi-modal image alignment and analysis by information manifolds
MIAAIM is a software to align multiple-omics tissue imaging data. The worflow includes high-dimensional image compression, registration, and transforming images to align in the same spatial domain. MIAAIM was developed at the [Vaccine and Immunotherapy Center at MGH](http://advancingcures.org) in the labs of [Dr. Patrick Reeves](http://advancingcures.org/reeves-lab/) and [Dr. Ruxandra SÃ®rbulescu](http://advancingcures.org/sirbulescu-lab/). MIAAIM is written in [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io) with containerized workflows to enable modular development and application across diverse computing architectures.
