MIAAIM: multi-modal image alignment and analysis by information manifolds
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
MIAAIM is a software to align multiple-omics tissue imaging data.
The worflow includes high-dimensional image compression, registration, and
transforming images to align in the same spatial domain. MIAAIM was developed at
the `Vaccine and Immunotherapy Center at MHG <http://advancingcures.org>`_
in the labs of `Dr. Patrick Reeves <http://advancingcures.org/reeves-lab/>`_
and `Dr. Ruxandra SÃ®rbulescu <http://advancingcures.org/sirbulescu-lab/>`_.
MIAAIM is written in `Nextflow <https://www.nextflow.io>`_ with containerized
workflows to enable modular development and application across diverse computing
architectures.

MIAIM is under active development! All tutorials are subject to change
in the future. To update your current version, pull the latest release
from GitHub with :code:`nextflow pull JoshuaHess12/miaaim`.
