      MIAAIM is a software to align and analyze multiple-omics tissue imaging data.
      The workflow includes high-dimensional image compression, registration, and
      tissue state modelling.

      MIAAIM was developed by
      `Joshua Hess <https://github.com/JoshuaHess12>`_ at
      the `Vaccine and Immunotherapy Center at MHG <http://advancingcures.org>`_
      in the labs of `Dr. Ruxandra SÃ®rbulescu <http://advancingcures.org/sirbulescu-lab/>`_
      and `Dr. Patrick Reeves <http://advancingcures.org/reeves-lab/>`_.
      It is written in `Nextflow <https://www.nextflow.io>`_ with containerized
      workflows to enable modular development and reproducible
      image data integration across diverse computing architectures.

      For an introduction to how MIAAIM is set up and implemented,
      visit the :ref:`quick start <quick start to quick start>`
      guide and implement some of the prototype use cases. For a complete
      description of the project, check our paper on xxx.
